# address_book_js

Requirements -

Build a simple address book application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. It’s a single page, that opens in the browser, where the user can create new contacts, delete contacts, and use a search bar to find existing contacts. Each contact should have a name, surname, phone number, and address. The data doesn’t need to be persisted when the browser page is closed.
